# Basics of brute force.

This repositorie contains severals algorithms to brute force, I've been working in this kind of combinations just for finding new ways to work with this specific problem! the complexity of the classical brute force is O(n!) which is mean a rough algorithm.

You can't crack a password and this is the real reason ($O(n!)$). 

You're free to prove this code, don't modify tho without my consent.
